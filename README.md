## Technologies

* Python <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi" class="external-link" target="_blank">**FastAPI**</a> backend:
    * **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
    * **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
    * **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    * **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
    * **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
    * **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="http://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.
    * <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/" class="external-link" target="_blank">**Many other features**</a> including automatic validation, serialization, interactive documentation, authentication with OAuth2 JWT tokens, etc.
* **Secure password** hashing by default.
* **JWT token** authentication.
* **SQLAlchemy** models (independent of Flask extensions, so they can be used with Celery workers directly).
* Basic starting models for users (modify and remove as you need).
* **Alembic** migrations.
* **CORS** (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
* **Celery** worker that can import and use models and code from the rest of the backend selectively.
* REST backend tests based on **Pytest**, integrated with Docker, so you can test the full API interaction, independent on the database.
